# Team State

This file is the orchestrator's source of truth between heartbeat ticks / between sessions. Each role updates its own section; the orchestrator reads this file on resume and at the start of each tick to spot stalls, instead of re-deriving "where are we" from conversation history.

**Conventions:**
- Each section is owned by one role. Don't edit other roles' sections.
- Last-updated timestamp uses ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- "Stale" = no update for 2+ heartbeat ticks (~40 min in away mode) **while a tick was active**. Long gaps when the user is asleep / paused are not stale.
- The **Current state** header at the top is the authoritative "what's going on right now" — supersedes the per-role sections below. Older per-role updates are append-only history.

## Current state — 2026-05-23 (M1 9/11 complete; M1-09 + M1-10 remain; bloat-prevention bundle landing)

**This header is the live "what's going on right now" entry. Per-role sections further down are append-only history. Read this header first on resume.**

- **`origin/main` tip:** `57c78a7` (orch-doc commit — peer-reviewer-worktree-blocks-delete-branch failure mode capture). Verify: `git rev-parse origin/main`.
- **M1 status:** 9 / 11 tickets complete. Two remain, both sequential on Felix's lane:
  - **M1-09** — `feat(cli): reducer + agent-tree CLI driver` (ClickUp `86c9y5chc`, status `to do`). Owner Felix, reviewer Maya. Dependencies all merged.
  - **M1-10** — `test(m1): integration tests against fixture filesystem` (ClickUp `86c9y5cmg`, status `to do`). Owner Sage, reviewer Felix. Depends on M1-09.
- **Test counts on main right now:** matcher 28 + loader 16 + metaJsonLoader 23 + subagentTailer 13 + sessionRegistry 19 = **99 unit tests, all green** at `57c78a7`. CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Open PRs at session-start:** none. Last merged: PR #13 (M1-07 sessions/PID registry).
- **Worktrees:** all six detached at session-start (none holding a branch). Felix worktree at `b19c5bf`; Sage at `8fc667c`. See § Worktree state below.
- **In-flight agents:** none. Safe to dispatch.
- **Auto-status:** ON (local), 5-min pulse, cron job `a88bd803` (`3-58/5 * * * *`).
- **This session's structural changes (orch-doc bundle):**
  - Extracted failure-mode entries from `.claude/docs/orchestration-overview.md` → `team/log/process-incidents.md` (NEW).
  - Repurposed `team/STATE.md` (this file) as between-tick source of truth (was previously Nora's coord-doc run-log; her entries folded into her per-role history section below).
  - Created `team/DECISIONS.md` (NEW) as append-only decisions log.
  - Created `.claude/retros/` (NEW) for milestone retros.
  - Refined CLAUDE.md hard rule #8 to cite context-bloat rationale + added CI-status command discipline.

**Single most useful next action:** dispatch Felix on M1-09. Worktree `c:\Trunk\PRIVATE\ClaudeTeam-felix-wt`, branch `felix/m1-09-cli-driver` from `origin/main`. Self-Test Report required (first UX-visible PR).

Felix's dispatch on M1-09 will start with `git -C <felix-wt> fetch origin && git checkout -B felix/m1-09-cli-driver origin/main` — standard Step 0.

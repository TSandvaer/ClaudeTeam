# Team State

This file is the orchestrator's source of truth between heartbeat ticks / between sessions. Each role updates its own section; the orchestrator reads this file on resume and at the start of each tick to spot stalls, instead of re-deriving "where are we" from conversation history.

**Conventions:**
- Each section is owned by one role. Don't edit other roles' sections.
- Last-updated timestamp uses ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- "Stale" = no update for 2+ heartbeat ticks (~40 min in away mode) **while a tick was active**. Long gaps when the user is asleep / paused are not stale.
- The **Current state** header at the top is the authoritative "what's going on right now" — supersedes the per-role sections below. Older per-role updates are append-only history.

## Current state — 2026-05-24 1935 UTC (M3 Wave 1 — `86c9ybrk0` + M3-07 + M3-08 all SHIPPED this tick; 3 PRs merged; M3-04 NITs + M3-09 + M3-10 remaining)

**This header is the live "what's going on right now" entry. Per-role sections further down are append-only history. Read this header first on resume.**

- **`origin/main` tip:** `0fbf028` (PR #41 merge — Felix + Maya M3-03 DEAD-bleed fix). Three PRs merged this tick: #41 (`0fbf028`), #42 (`0a5bc5e` — M3-07 Nora install-path validation), #43 (`236c3f8` — M3-08 Nora main-thread narration). Auto-merge audit logged at `.claude/decisions-while-away.md` 1934 UTC.
- **M3 Wave 0 SHIPPED end-to-end** (prior session — 6 PRs merged to main): M3-01 hot-reload (PR #35, `a74cb94`), M3-02 openRoster command (PR #37, `d0225aa`), M3-03 window-scoped session filtering (PR #38, `1bc422c`), M3-04 webview chip + filtered-empty + open-roster button (PR #39, `b22de25`), M3-01-NITs cleanup (PR #40, `9c0572c`), plus M3-06 dispatch-template update (PR #36, `cd3553c`). Sponsor's M3 scope-correction directive ("show only sessions from this VS Code window") addressed via M3-03 default-on window-scoping with `claudeteam.showAllSessionsGlobally` opt-out.
- **Test counts:** 281 unit (+2 pre-existing skips) + 68 integration + 23 Layer-3 green on main as of PR #44 merge (M3-09 added 3 new Layer-3 suites + 13 NIT-gap unit tests).
- **Open PRs:** none. PR #44 (M3-09) merged at `e9d2457` this tick; Felix APPROVE.
- **In-flight agents:** none. Felix, Sage, Maya, Nora, Iris, Bram all idle.
- **Held for sponsor return:** **`86c9ybtut` (M3-04 NITs: model fallback / error format / finished timestamp)** dispatch held — ticket body isn't in repo, only ClickUp which orch MCP can't read this session. Need sponsor to either (a) paste ticket body or (b) confirm Felix+Maya can interpret NIT descriptions from PR #39 review comments + codebase context. Sponsor's "split per surface" preference recorded; once context unblocks, dispatch is Felix host (NIT #1+#2) + Maya webview (NIT #3) in parallel.
- **Auto-decide this tick (logged at `.claude/decisions-while-away.md` 2026-05-24 1801 UTC):** Path 1 absorb webview-scope into `86c9ybrk0` + redispatch Felix on same PR, vs Path 2 (close as misdiagnosed + new ticket for Maya). Foundation: Felix's audit + Path Y economy precedent. Reversibility ≤1 PR.
- **Queued for sponsor (non-blocking):**
  - **M3-10 ticket creation** — sponsor authorized `File M3-10 ticket now (P3)` at session resume; heuristic chosen = `group by roster persona-name, show 'Felix ×3' with expandable list`. Orchestrator's ClickUp MCP did not connect this session, so NEW-TICKET-REQUEST block added to `team/log/clickup-pending.md` for next session with live MCP. Sponsor can also file manually using the body block already drafted there.
  - **M3-04 NITs (`86c9ybtut`) split-preference** noted for Wave 1 dispatch: Felix host (NIT #1 model:? fallback + NIT #2 error format), Maya webview (NIT #3 finished timestamp). Sponsor's explicit "Split per surface" answer overrides "bundle" recommendation.
  - **M3 close + retro timing:** deferred until all Wave 1 work (NITs + chores M3-07/08/09) ships, per sponsor's explicit answer.
- **Sponsor-held tickets (no action):** `86c9y7y9z` (M2-04 NITs) — standing "leave at to do" call, do NOT auto-close.
- **Auto-status:** AWAY re-engaged 2026-05-24T17:45Z, this-session cron `dfc3430f` (`7,22,37,52 * * * *`). State file `enabled=true, mode=away, interval=15m, last_tick=2026-05-24T17:45:00Z`.
- **Working tree:** clean of code modifications. 4 untracked Maya scratch files at `team/maya-dev/pr-*.md` (sub-agent review-body drafts from prior PRs; NOT coord state — leave untracked or sponsor moves to `.scratch/` at later call).
- **New documented failure mode this session:** parallel-orchestrator race condition (two Claude Code sessions on same project). Documented in `.claude/docs/orchestration-overview.md` § Common failure modes + full entry in `team/log/process-incidents.md`. Prevention: only ONE Claude Code session should orchestrate a given project at a time; kill the other's auto-status via `/auto-status off` first.
- **CLAUDE.md global rule #8 added** (prior session, sponsor-authorized): tickets/bugs/postmortems must cite sources for concrete values; speculative claims labeled `Hypothesis:` / `Likely:` / `Predicted:`. Triggered by ticket `86c9ybrk0` fabrication incident (now corrected via audit-trail comment).

**ClickUp board state:**
- **Complete (M3 Wave 0):** `86c9yaq1e` (M3-01), `86c9yb473` (M3-02), `86c9yb59k` (M3-03), `86c9ybdxe` (M3-04), `86c9yb0yg` (M3-01-NITs).
- **Complete (M3 Wave 1 this session):** `86c9ybrk0` (M3-03 DEAD-bleed fix, PR #41 merged `0fbf028`) — orch-side `-> complete` flip queued via clickup-pending.md (MCP unavailable).
- **In progress:** none.
- **To do (open follow-ups):** `86c9ybtut` (M3-04 NITs split, P3); `86c9y7y9z` (M2-04 NITs, sponsor-held).
- **To do (pending creation):** M3-10 persona-tile-collapse (P3, sponsor-authorized, NEW-TICKET-REQUEST queued).
- **Orch-direct Wave 1 (no ClickUp):** M3-07 (PR #42 merged `0a5bc5e`), M3-08 (PR #43 merged `236c3f8`) — DONE.

**Wave 1 remaining (per Nora's backlog):**
- **`86c9ybtut`** — M3-04 NITs (Felix host NIT #1+#2 + Maya webview NIT #3 split per sponsor's preference, 2 PRs) — HELD pending sponsor's ticket-body context (model fallback / error format / finished timestamp specifics not in repo).
- **M3-10** — persona-tile-collapse (post ticket-creation; ticket creation queued in clickup-pending.md awaiting MCP).
- **DONE this session:** `86c9ybrk0` (PR #41), M3-07 (PR #42), M3-08 (PR #43), M3-09 (PR #44 — incl. PR-#39 NIT-gap absorption).

### Nora (Project Lead)

- Last updated: 2026-05-24 (M2-close retro authored)
- Status: idle (M2-close retro shipped)

**Run log of substantive coordination-doc PRs (newest at top):**

#### 2026-05-24 — M2-close retro authored

- Retro: `.claude/retros/retro-2026-05-24-m2-close.md` (~3100 words; comparable to M1 retro depth, slightly longer to cover 12 merged PRs + 10 auto-decisions)
- Surfaced 10/10 auto-decide / 0-reversal calibration finding → recommendation to promote more rule 6.6 classes (NITs-ticket-creation, log-only-conflict recovery, NITs-absorption-into-downstream)
- Surfaced chain-of-deferred-validations anti-pattern (M2-01 placeholder-screenshot deferral → M2-06 sub-agent-GUI deferral → CJS shim bug only caught at M2-08 Layer-3 in PR #29)
- 8 next-session backlog items filed (M3 scope confirm, auto-decide promotion draft, ENTRY-NNN collision prevention, cross-project port of GUI-gap + permission-rule, test-plan executor mapping discipline, install-path validation at first-shipping PR, main-thread merge-narration tightening, M3 Layer-3 expansion)
- Branch: `nora/m2-close-retro`

#### 2026-05-23 — M1 backlog created

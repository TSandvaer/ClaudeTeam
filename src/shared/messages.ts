 * carries no symmetric un-remove message — unlike hide's
 * `ui:show-member` / `ui:show-all-hidden` pair.
 *
 * Distinct message type (NOT a `ui:hide-member` overload) per the messages.ts
 * "add a new type, don't overload" rule: remove has different persistence
 * semantics (no in-UI reversal) and a different filter (suppresses past the
 * show-hidden surface). Payload carries the `(teamId, memberId)` PAIR — the

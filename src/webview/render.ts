/**
 * render — top-level dashboard renderer.
 *
 * Owns the DOM mount: takes an AgentTree, builds the session blocks, replaces
 * the contents of `#root`. AC3 of M2-05.
 *
 * Re-render discipline (AC7):
 *   - `renderFull(state)`     — replace mount contents wholesale. Called on
 *                               `state:full` messages and on init.
 *   - `applyDelta(state, d)`  — at M2-05 this is a no-op fallback that triggers
 *                               a full re-render against an already-known state.
 *                               Live delta application is M4 optimization per
 *                               spec OQ §2 / backlog M2-05 AC7 footnote — the
 *                               webview doesn't invent a delta strategy ahead
 *                               of the host wiring delta emission.
 *
 * Empty-state rule (M2-05 + M3-04 AC4): if `state.sessions` is empty OR all
 * sessions are dead, the mount shows only `renderEmptyState()`. M3-04 splits
 * the empty branch by `state.filterApplied`:
 *   - filterApplied === true → the filtered-empty variant ("No Claude Code
 *     sessions for this workspace. Run `claude` in this folder, or enable
 *     `claudeteam.showAllSessionsGlobally`...").
 *   - otherwise              → the M2-05 generic variant ("No live Claude
 *     Code sessions.").
 *
 * Error chip layering (top → bottom of the mount):
 *   1. `rosterErrorChip`     — M3-04 data-driven roster errors (from
 *                              `state.rosterErrors`). Persists across ticks
 *                              until either the user dismisses (×) OR the
 *                              first error message changes.
 *   2. legacy `errorChip`    — M2-05 event-driven chip from
 *                              `roster:error` / file-watcher events.
 *                              Preserved for back-compat with M2-05's
 *                              dispatch pattern.
